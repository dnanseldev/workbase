# Purpose 
# -> Indicate the compiler of the file

# Template
# -> Ex: bash: #!/bin/bash

# Tempate bash
> #!/bin/bash

# Template Python
> #!/usr/bin/python2
> #!/usr/bin/python3

# Obs: The shebang must match with the version of the compiler

# Using shebang dinamically(Look for the bash in all directories located in $PATH). It turns the script portable
> #!/usr/bin/env bash
